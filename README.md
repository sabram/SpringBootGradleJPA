SpringBootGradleJPA
===================
Simple Spring Boot project, built using Gradle, using JPA for persistence.

JPA part still in progress!

Based on initial SpringBootGradle template at https://github.com/sabram/SpringBootGradle

To run, use one of the following options:
* ./gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/spring-boot-gradle-jpa-0.1.0.jar (does not require gradle to be preinstalled)
* gradle bootRun (if you already have gradle installed)
* run the Application class (e.g. if you have imported in to your IDE)

Then access http://localhost:8080
